Boundary between solid and liquid: It is necessary to change the parameters and check the change in MSD. Therefore, it is quite difficult because it is necessary to change the parameters and perform calculations many times.

MSD: Constant for solids, increasing for liquids

RDF: Sharp peak for solids, sloppy shape for liquids
