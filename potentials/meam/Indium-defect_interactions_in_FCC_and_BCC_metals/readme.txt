1. The values ​​are mostly set by the calculation of "Assumption". 
However, we used the values ​​in the table in the paper. Most of the binary systems match the calculation of "Assumption",
but the ternary systems are different.
2. The calculation formula for "Assumption" in the paper forgets to include the squares, 
because most of the values ​​match the table when they are squared.
