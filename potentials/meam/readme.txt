I was unable to obtain values ​​close to those found in the literature.
I apologize for this being due to my lack of ability.
#-------------------------------------------------------------
TiVN: The unknown parameters were changed to bring the elastic constants closer to the TiV values.
#-------------------------------------------------------------
TM-N(TM=Ti,V,Cr,Fe): The unknown parameters were changed in the same way as TiVN, but the elastic constants do not match those in the literature.
#-------------------------------------------------------------
TiCrN: The unknown parameters were changed in the same way as TiVN, but the elastic constants do not match those in the literature.
