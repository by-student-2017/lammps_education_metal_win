d is fitted to a modified Rose universal curve (erose_form = 2) at 7 points at EOS and set to 0 or 0.05, whichever is closer.

When 1NN-MEAM is reported, b0 to b3 and t1 to t3 are used as is. No anomalous values ​​such as 1000 GPa are found.
Strictly speaking, it would be necessary to refit, but for now we only did a quick check. This is because it is more important to prepare elements that have not been reported. When the difference between the DFT and experimental values ​​is used as a correction value for the reference structure, the absolute difference between the DFT and MEAM values ​​is usually within 0.02 to 0.06 [eV/atom] (in some cases it is around 0.1 to 0.2). The difference is generally of the same sign (i.e., the values ​​can be compared relatively).
