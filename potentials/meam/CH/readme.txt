According to a 2014 study by Nouranian et al., the MEAM potential performs as well as REBO for saturated hydrocarbons (C-H systems) and has even better predictive accuracy than ReaxFF. Specifically, the MEAM potential accurately predicts the energies of C-C and C-H bonds, and shows good agreement with experimental data and first-principles calculations for the structures and energies of saturated hydrocarbons.

However, the MEAM potential does not have the same accuracy as REBO and ReaxFF for aromatic compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons, so it can be difficult to apply it to these systems.1

Nevertheless, for saturated hydrocarbons in general, the MEAM potential is very effective and can be considered to perform as well as REBO.
