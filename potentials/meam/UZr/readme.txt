# "Note that to use this potential with LAMMPS, LAMMPS requires a modified cutoff function before compiling."
# I have made the parameters described in the paper closer to MEAM in Lammps, but due to lack of knowledge, I have commented out delta, legend, xncut, xmcut, etc. If you wish to use it, you will need to follow the NIST notes or create a new file with reference to this file.
