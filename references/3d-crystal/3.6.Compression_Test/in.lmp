#Compression Test:
#In this experiment we also test the hardness of the materials at -0.1 strain rate with similar temperature (i.e. 
# Room temperature) . Unlike the tensile testing here we get deformation of the Copper at a very low strain rate. 
#The codes for compression in MD Simulations is same as Tensile simulation but here only the strain rate is 
# negative and run time is much smaller in compare to tensile simulation.
