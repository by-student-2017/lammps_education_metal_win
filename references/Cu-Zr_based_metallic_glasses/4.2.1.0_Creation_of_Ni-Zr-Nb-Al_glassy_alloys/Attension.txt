The original "library.meam" at NIST doesn't work because there are no line breaks for Hf. 
As with other elements, line breaks are inserted to arrange the digits of the numbers.

Please consult the authors and NIST if you have any problems.

I was surprised by this result because I put a lot of faith in the data from NIST and the authors of the papers.
