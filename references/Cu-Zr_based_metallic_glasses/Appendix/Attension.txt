In EAM, the accuracy of systems with strong angular dependence is low.
"ZrBeTiCuNi_Zhou04.eam.alloy", "ZrCuNiAlNb_Zhou04.eam.alloy" and "PdNiP_Zhou04.eam.alloy" were just tried. 
The fit by DFT alone is also poor, so I would like you to use potfit to perform more accurate calculations with MEAM and ADP.
You may combine potentials with guaranteed accuracy using a "hybrid".
