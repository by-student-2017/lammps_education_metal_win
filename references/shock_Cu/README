This supplementary file is the LAMMPS input file (in.Cu_shock) used to perform the suite of impulsively shocked copper LAMMPS simulations. To run LAMMPS with this input file, the LAMMPS implementation of the interatomic potential from DOI:63:224106 (available at github.com/lammps/lammps/blob/master/potentials/Cu_mishin1.eam.alloy) must be placed in the same folder as the script. Additionally, LAMMPS must be built with the # packages, JPEG, PNG, MANYBODY, COLLOID, GRANULAR, MOLECULE. In bash, the following command will run the input script,

lammps -in in.Cu_shock -var pistvel ${pistvel} -var system_size 10 -var temp_equil ${temp} -var press_equil 0.0

where ${pistvel} and ${temp} are the desired initial velocity and temperature.
