### 4.2 Creations of Cu-Ni thin films & Indentation Procedures
# While creating Cu-Ni thin films one thing has to be kept in mind that is the dimension 
# of underlying Copper should remain unchanged. Only the thickness of Ni layer over Cu is to 
# be varied as per our requirement. The various Ni layer thickness used in this work are 6 Angstrom, 
# 20 Angstrom, 50 Angstrom. While varying the Nickel layer thickness other two parameters for the 
# simulations (strain rate & temperature) are kept fixed.

# The in file code for creating a Cu-Ni thin film with 6 Angstrom thick Ni layer and 
# subsequently indenting the same is as below. 

# in file for creation of Cu-Ni thin film with Ni layer of 6 Angstrom & indentation of the same 
# with a strain rate of 0.05 Angstrom/ps and temperature of 300K
