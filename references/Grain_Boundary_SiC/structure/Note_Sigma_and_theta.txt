  Typically the classification of various CSL GBs uses the notation Σ, which is
inverse of the ratio between number of coincident lattice sites between the two 
respective lattices. For example Σ5 indicates that 1 in 5 lattice sites between lattice 1
and lattice 2 are coincident (see Fig. 1.2 for more details). Interestingly, these values
are always odd for cubic crystals [22]. One additional feature of the CSL model is it
provides means to generate all permissible Σ’s for cubic structures using Ranganathan
[26] generating functions which are given as:

  Σ = a^2 + (u^2 + v^2 + w^2)*b^2
  tan(θ/2) = (b/a)*(u^2 + v^2 + w^2)^0.5

  where the variables a and b are integer pairs that are greater or equal to zero.
If the values obtained for Σ in Eq.(s) (1.4)-(1.5) are even integers, they must be
iteratively divided by 2 until the final result is an odd integer. For a cubic lattice
with a rotation axis of h001i the resulting Σ’s with various generating integers are
shown in Table 1.1. In reality the experimental observation of exact match between
GB misorientation and that predicted by CSL model is particularly low. This is
due to the fact that the CSL model does not account for any microscopic degrees of
freedom and additionally impurities which may exist at the GB. However, the unique
properties associated these CSL structures can still exist when small deviations from
exact CSL occur [27].

  Finally, the more widely used concept of tilt and twist GB can be addressed under
the CSL model, namely, if the GB plane or normal vectors n1 and n2 are known we
can classify the tilt and twist components. For example in the case of a pure twist
GBs the vectors n1 and n2, corresponding to the normal vectors of grain 1 and grain
2, are parallel with the rotation axis [uvw]. In the case of tilt GB both vectors are
perpendicular. Furthermore a tilt GB can be classified as symmetric and asymmetric,
a symmetric tilt GB is one where the n1 and n2 point along the same family of 
crystallographic directions (i.e. n1 = [110] and n2 = [110]), therefore possessing mirror
symmetry. In an asymmetric tilt GB n1 and n2 point along different crystallographic
directions however they remain commensurate and thus CSL occurrences exist.
