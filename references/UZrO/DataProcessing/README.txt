This folder contains the MATLAB scripts required to produce the data and plots seen in the paper.

AtomPositionGenerator.m - Generates a list of randomised cations
kappa.m - Calculates the thermal conductivity value for a given supercell size
kappa2.m - As above except uses x direction instead of z - direction for calculations
LP.m - Function file to calculate the lattice parameter, thermal expansion and heat capacity
PlotGeneratorUZrO2 - Uses all the function files to produce data and plots it with experimental data.
ThermalConductivity - Collates the values calculated using kappa and kappa2 and uses these to determine bulk conductivity.
