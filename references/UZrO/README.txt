The following contains information regarding the layout of data in this repository

All data relates to the molecular dynamics simulations of (U,Zr)O2 using LAMMPS

The raw data including LAMMPS input files and output files are located in the LAMMPS folder;

From this several sets of data were extracted and renamed for use in MATLAB. These files are contained in
the ExtractedData Folder.

DataProcessing contains all MATLAB files required to regenerate the figures and to make all calculations.

Throughout these folders the compositions are referenced using uranium content

U100 = UO2
U0 = ZrO2

etc...
