The folders here refer to

kappa - the thermal conductivity infiles and outfiles used in LAMMPS
LP - the infiles and outfiles used in LAMMPS for determining lattice parameter, heat capacity and thermal expansion
MP - the infiles and outfiles used in LAMMPS for determining the melting points. 

The file UZrO.eam.alloy contains the description of the interatomic potential CRG in tabulated format.

N.B All dump files have been deleted in order to reduce file size. These can all be reproduced by running the infiles in LAMMPS.
