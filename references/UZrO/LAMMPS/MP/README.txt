This repository contains the folders for each composition that was tested for Melting Point.
The folder names refer to the uranium content as a % of total cation (U100 = UO2)

U25
U50
U75
U100

Within each of these folders is a test temperature folder. For U100:

3050
3000

And within these folders are the LAMMPS infiles required to generate the dumps which can be used to determine if the structure has melted or not:

MeltingPoint.lmpin
*.lmpstruct

Due to space limitations the dump files have not been kept in this repository.
