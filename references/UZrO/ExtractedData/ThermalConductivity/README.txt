This folder contains all the LAMMPS data used for determining the thermal conductivity.
These were organised into folders based on:

Composition:
U0
U0Xdirection
U25
U50
U75
U100

Temperature:
300K
500K
750K
1000K
1250K
1500K
2000K
2500K
3000K

Simulation Size:
5x5x20
5x5x40
5x5x60

Each of these final folders contains the following
flux_log.out
tmp_profile.out
lattice.out

They are organised in this way in order to make finding them through matlab easier without renaming each individual file.
