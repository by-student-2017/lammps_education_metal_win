# 4.4 Tensile Deformation of Quenched Specimens

# To do deformation for different sizes at a particular strain rate, read data file was 
# changed according to the size concerned by accessing the data in the dump file obtained after 
# simulation of quenching. . Similarly, to do deformation at different strain rates for same size
# the strain rate which is mentioned as ‘erate’ in the in.file was changed accordingly.

# # In.file for 3d tensile simulation ( at strain rate 10^11 s^-1)
