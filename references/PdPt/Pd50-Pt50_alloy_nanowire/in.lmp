### The following commands describe the input script for creating a Pd50-Pt50 alloy nanowire.

## Initialization
# Definitions of the units that are going to be used during the simulation i.e. metal units are: 
# distance = Angstrom, time = picoseconds, energy = eV, velocity = Angstrom/ps, temperature = K, pressure = bar.

units metal
echo both

# The boundary conditions that are employed in LAMMPS are:
# ppp; p p s; p f p
# Where p stands for periodic along the three directions, f and s stand for fixed and
# shrink wrapped, which are non-periodic.
boundary p p p

#Definition of the simulation dimensions, in this case 3D.
dimension 3

# Atom and Lattice definition
# The atomic type is the one that matches better with metals simulation.

## Force field

# Choice of the interatomical potential that is going to be used and the directory to find the parameters.
# The Åg*Åh indicates that the potential is going to be applied between all the types of atoms defined.

## Setting
# LAMMPS performs an energy minimization of the system, by iteratively regulating atom coordinates.
# The minimizers hurdle the far away atoms movement in single iteration, 
# so that it is possible to slow down systems with exceedingly overlie atoms (huge energies and forces) by
# approaching the atoms off each other.

# Definition of the frequency with which the output information is going to be registered and 
# which variables are going to be recorded.

# The output of the LAMMPS simulation is written onto text files called dump file containing 
# the information of the atom coordinates along with the velocities dumped at the required 
# timestep. While the thermodynamic information of the simulation is stored in as log file.
