Downloading OVITO... Basic, Pro, and, Legacy (2.9.0) 
The current release of OVITO (3.4.1 as of writing) is offered in the Basic (free) or Pro (paid license) versions. A list of the features available to the Basic version or limited exclusively to the Pro version can be found in the version history (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ovito.org%2Fabout%2Fversion-history%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1TUvcUQ5l8DUXjeYkv1UGr). 

Another open option for users is reverting to a version before the basic/pro branch, specifically 2.9.0 - this sacrifices many new capabilities in exchange for several features (such as the python scripting interface) that are currently limited to the Pro version. A list of all available versions for download is located on the other downloads page (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ovito.org%2Fdownload-other%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1Salfc2VzHdWm-tT_dvOuI). 

	For posterity I have archived the 2.9 version here. I always suggest referring to the official site for 		downloads, again (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ovito.org%2Fdownload-other%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1Salfc2VzHdWm-tT_dvOuI): OVITO downloads page.
