 Techniques such as this one, which use hybrids to fill in missing element parameters with 
Morse potentials, have been reported frequently in the literature.

 Since NIST does not have a wide range of parameter combinations for precious metals in EAM 
and MEAM, it may be a good idea to supplement them with Morse potentials.

 I would be happy if they could provide parameters for all elements in the Zhou 2004 format. 
 I would also be happy if they were to complete it with MEAM or Tersoff.
