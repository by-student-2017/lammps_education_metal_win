=========================== The tpi MATLAB script =============================

 This file contains instructions for running the script.
 
 README file in one directory up provides an introduction to the script. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 To run the TPI script in MATLAB the following toolbox is required:

 Optimization Toolbox containing `lsqcurvefit' function which solves nonlinear
 curve-fitting (data-fitting) problems in least-squares sense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    INSTRUCTIONS for running this tpi script release:

1. Open the script in the directory where the required input files are provided.
   Hit F5 on the script file or execute `tpi' in the command window.

2. Verify that the compilation was successful by running an example. One example 
   is provided with the release. The example has its temperature and heat current 
   data in `tempCurrent.%d.ensemble' files, where `%d' refers to the ensemble 
   number. This data was obtained by performing a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
   simulation of an argon beam of size 33 x 4 x 4 unit cells. The beam is divided 
   into 11 bins. Initially the whole beam is kept at a sinusoidal temperature 
   distribution along the length of the beam of the following form:
   
   \theta_n = \theta_0 + \Delta\theta_0 \cos(2 \pi n/(\nbins-1)), 0 \le n \le \nbins-1,

   where \theta_0 and \Delta\theta_0 are the base temperature and amplitude of the 
   perturbation in the base temperature, respectively, and \nbins is the total 
   number of bins. In this example, \nbins = 11, \theta_0 = 36.2 K, and 
   \Delta\theta_0 = 0.1 \theta_0 = 3.62 K. Then the heated nanobeam is allowed to 
   relax under periodic boundary conditions. The file `TPI.INPUT' contains all 
   parameters needed for running the example.

   To run the code just execute the script file `tpi' in the directory where 
   both input files are present. 

   Please also see the documentation provided with the source package.
