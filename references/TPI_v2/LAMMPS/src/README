=================== The LAMMPS scripts and additional LAMMPS features ========================

 This file provides an introduction to additional LAMMPS features used in the LAMMPS script for 
 TPI calculation. 

 Additional LAMMPS features used by the script:
 ---------------------------------------------
 The scripts use two additional LAMMPS `fix` commands and one additional LAMMPS `compute' command. 
 More about fix and compute commands of LAMMPS can be found at http://lammps.sandia.gov/. These 
 additional commands are:
 
 1. fix langevin/layer command: This is a modified form of fix langevin which creates bins (layers) 
                                of same length along the x-axis. Then it applies independent Langevin
                                thermostats to each bin to achieve a sinusoidal temperature 
                                distribution of the following form:
                                
                                T_n = theta0 + dtheta0 cos(2 \pi n/(Nbins-1)), 0 <= n <= Nbins-1,
                                
                                where Nbins is the total number of bins, and theta0 is the base or 
                                mean temperature of the sinusoidal distribution and dtheta0 is the 
                                amplitude of this distribution. More about this command can be found 
                                in the file "fix_langevin_layer.html" available in the ${PWD}/doc 
                                directory. In the example scripts, this command is invoked as follows:
                                
                                fix 100 all langevin/layer ${theta0} ${dtheta0} ${tdamp} 48279 ${Nbins} 

                                Here, ${tdamp} is the damping parameter of the Langevin thermostats and
                                the integer `48279' is used for generating random numbers.
 
 2. compute temp/heat/flux/layer 
    command:                    This is a modified form of compute heat/flux which performs binning 
                                every time when it is invoked and then calculates the temperature of 
                                each bin, ranging from 1 to Nbins, and its x-component of heat current 
                                vector based on contributions from atoms in each bin. This can be used 
                                by itself to measure the heat flux into or out of a reservoir of atoms 
                                or to calculate a thermal conductivity using the Green-Kubo formalism 
                                or the Direct method or the TPI method. More about this command can be 
                                found in the file "compute_temp_heat_flux_layer.html" available in the 
                                ${PWD}/doc directory. In the example scripts, this command is invoked as 
                                follows:
                                
                                compute 5 all temp/heat/flux/layer myPE myStress ${Nbins}

                                Here myPE and myStress help calculating potential energy and virial 
                                stress of each bin. See "compute_temp_heat_flux_layer.html" for 
                                further info. 
 
 3. fix binAve/time command:    This is a modified version of fix ave/time which uses one or more global
                                values as inputs every few timesteps, and average them over longer 
                                timescales. When it is called as follows:
                                
                                fix 16 all binAve/time ${nev} ${nrep} ${nfreq} ${Nbins} 2 c_5 ave one & 
                                                            file tempCurrent.$i.ensemble mode vector  
                                
                                then this command generates an output file in the following format: 
                                
                                #<Title 1>
                                #<Title 2>
                                #<Title 3>
                                1  temperature_1  heat_current_1
                                2  temperature_2  heat_current_2
                                . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
                                . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
                                Nbins  temperature_Nbins  heat_current_Nbins
                                <blank line>
                                1  temperature_1  heat_current_1
                                2  temperature_2  heat_current_2
                                . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
                                . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
                                Nbins  temperature_Nbins  heat_current_Nbins
                                <blank line>
                                etc.

                                Here we have a series of temperature and heat current profiles at 
                                consecutive time steps separated by blank lines. Each profile in three 
                                columns provides for all `Nbins' bins, the bin numbers, temperatures 
                                (in degrees Kelvin), and x-components of heat current vectors 
                                (J_x = q_x V) in energy*velocity units, where q_x is the heat-flux and 
                                V is the volume of each bin). 
                                
                                This command gives the above file formatting only when it chooses vector
                                mode in its arguments. More about the mode and this command can be found
                                in the file "fix_binAve_time.html" available in the ${PWD}/doc directory.
