<PRE>compute ID group-ID temp/heat/flux/layer pe-ID stress-ID Nbins angmom value
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>temp/heat/flux/layer = style name of this compute command
<LI>pe-ID = ID of a compute that calculates per-atom potential energy
<LI>stress-ID = ID of a compute that calculates per-atom stress
<LI>Nbins = number of bins (or layers) along the length of the group (positive integer)
<LI> angmom keyword/value pair may be appended: It removes rigid-body rotation of
the bin from the velocity of the particle by subtracting the velocity caused by the
angular velocity of the bin (layer)

<LI>keyword = <I>angmom</I>

<PRE>  <I>angmom</I> value = <I>no</I> or <I>yes</I>
    <I>no</I> = do not remove the rigid-body rotation of the bin
    <I>yes</I> = remove the rigid-body rotation of the bin

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>  This is a modified form of <A HREF = "compute_heat_flux.html">compute heat/flux</A>. 
Performs binning every time when the compute is invoked and then calculates the
temperature of each bin, ranging from 1 to Nbins, and its x-component of heat current vector
based on contributions from atoms in each bin. This can be used by itself to measure the heat
flux into or out of a reservoir of atoms  or to calculate a thermal conductivity using
the Green-Kubo formalism or the Direct method or the TPI method.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "fix_thermal_conductivity.html">fix thermal/conductivity</A>
command for details on how to compute thermal conductivity in an
alternate way, via the Muller-Plathe method.  See the <A HREF = "fix_heat.html">fix
heat</A> command for a way to control the heat added or
subtracted to a group of atoms.
</P>
<P>The compute takes three arguments, of which two are IDs of other
<A HREF = "compute.html">computes</A>, and the third is the number of bins (layers)
along the length (x-axis). Among two compute IDs, one calculates per-atom potential
energy (<I>pe-ID)</I> and the second calcualtes per-atom stress (<I>stress-ID</I>).
These should be defined for the same group used by compute temp/heat/flux/layer,
though LAMMPS does not check for this.
</P>
<P>The heat current J for each bin is expressed as:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/heat_current_J.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P> where e_i in the first term of the equation for J is the per-atom energy
(potential and kinetic), calculated by the compute <I>pe-ID</I> and the per-atom
kinetic energy. S_i in the second term of the equation for J is the
per-atom stress tensor calculated by the compute <I>stress-ID</I>.  The
tensor multiplies V_i as a 3x3 matrix-vector multiply to yield a
vector. V_i is the velocity of particle <I>i</I> relative to the translational
center-of-mass velocity of the bin to which the particle belongs. Using the keyword
<I>angmom</I>, the rotational rigid-body motion can also be removed by subtracting
the velocity caused by the angular velocity of the bin (layer).
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <A HREF = "compute_pe_atom.html">compute pe/atom</A> and
<A HREF = "compute_stress_atom.html">compute stress/atom</A> commands have options
for which terms to include in their calculation (pair, bond, etc).
The heat flux calculation will thus include exactly the same terms.
Normally you should use <A HREF = "compute_stress_atom.html">compute stress/atom
virial</A> so as not to include a kinetic energy
term in the heat flux.
</P>
<P>This compute calculates 2 quantities -- temperature and x-component of heat current
vector -- for each bin and stores them in a (2*Nbins)-component vector. The odd elements
of this vector are temperatures and the even elements are x-component of heat current
vectors for all bins.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The temperature and heat current can be output every so many timesteps. Using the
<A HREF = "fix_binAve_time.html">fix binAve/time</A> command, the output can have the
following format specified in fix <I>binAve/time</I>:
<PRE>
    1  temperature_1  heat_current_1
    2  temperature_2  heat_current_2
    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
    n  temperature_n  heat_current_n
    <P></P>
    1  temperature_1  heat_current_1
    2  temperature_2  heat_current_2
    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   
    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   
    n  temperature_n  heat_current_n
</PRE>
The first column represents the bin numbers, and second and third columns refer to
corresponding temperature and x-component of heat current vector. The blank line separates
the temperature and heat current profiles.

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global vector of length (2*Nbins) (temperature and x-component
of heat current vector of each bin), which can be accessed by indices 1-(2*Nbins). These values
can be used by any command that uses global vector values from a compute as input.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">this section</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options. The use of <A HREF = "fix_binAve_time.html">fix binAve/time</A> command is recommended
to achieve the above format.
</P>
<P>Heat flux for each bin can be calculated by dividing the heat current by the bin volume.
</P>
<P>The heat current values will be in energy*velocity <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  Once
divided by a volume the units will be that of flux, namely
energy/area/time <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
