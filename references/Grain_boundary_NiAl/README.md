This repository contains the following files:

in.nickelPrecipShear - the input files to deform the nickel grain boundary systems 
data.0D - relaxed initial 0D system (compressed)
data.1D - relaxed initial 1D system (compressed)
data.2D - relaxed initial 2D system (compressed)

The data files was created by modifying code developed by [Mark Tschopp][4].

The potential for the Ni-Al system is located at the [NIST website][5].

The code used to deform the system was created by modifying code found used in the following publication:

S. J. Fensin, M. Asta and R. G. Hoagland. (2012) Structure and shear response of a âˆ‘11 asymmetric tilt grain boundary in copper from Molecular-Dynamics. Philosophical Magazine. V92, I34, pp4320-4333.

In order to generate the data discussed in this paper, the following procedure can be followed. 

1) Aquire a LAMMPS executable from the [LAMMPS website][6]. 

2) Aquire the Ni-Al Mishin Potential (2004)from the [NIST website][5].

3) Edit the input file (in.nickelPrecipShear) to include the data file for the desired simulation. 

4) Run the code.

5) Visualize the results using [Ovito][7].
