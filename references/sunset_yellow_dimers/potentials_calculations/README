These files are the input (.gin), output (.got) and final coordinate (.res) files for the 
vacuum SSY dimer calcs using GULP. Note that some configurations needed to be run through
GULP twice - in that case the .gin.orig is the first gulp file used and the .gin is the
restart file from the original run
