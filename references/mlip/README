There are the files for running LAMMPS with the trained MTP. 
The outputs of the LAMMPS are the information required by the TDEP method. 
You can use those outputs to calculate the effective IFCs at 900 K to compare with the results shown in the Support information (PDF).
Before running LAMMPS, a USER-package, namely the LAMMPS-MLIP interface, should be installed as other LAMMPS USER-packages.
Thanks to Prof. Alexander V Shapeev in Skolkovo Innovation Center, this interface can be downloaded on the website https://gitlab.com/ashapeev/interface-lammps-mlip-2.


data.init:       the initial structure for w-BAS
lammp900.in:     the LAMMPS input file to generate what the TDEP method requires.
mlip.ini:        describing the potential information
pothex.mtp:      the machine learning potential of w-BAs used in our work.
potcubic.mtp:    the machine learning potential of c-BAs used in our work.

Those potentials are generated by the MLIP package provided by Prof. Alexander V Shapeev [Email: a.shapeev@skoltech.ru].
It should be noted that those potentials are not suitable for calculating the force constant under a strain over 1%.
